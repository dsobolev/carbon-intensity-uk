# Carbon Intensity over main UK regions

Simple project with simple techs. Shows Carbon Intencity over England, Scotland, Wales and London,
with the use of [Carbon Intensity API](https://carbon-intensity.github.io/api-definitions/#carbon-intensity-api-v2-0-0).

### Techs used
- [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) - minimalistic JS framework
- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org) - JS charting tool
- JS modules

### Notes
- Just simple styling were applied here. App is not responsive, was developed/tested on comparatively small screen (15" laptop)
- Local server should be used to run the app. In my case, there was a PHP local server (`php -S localhost` in the main app folder)

### Possible enhancements
- to do - cache based on data.to, or for 30 min. LocalStorage
- external file to clear the main page
